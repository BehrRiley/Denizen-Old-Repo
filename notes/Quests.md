# Information
Many quests are a part of a series of quests that share a common plot-line. 

Progress in a quest series is made in a linear fashion, with each quest requiring the completion of the previous one. There are, however, a few exceptions to this progression, and are found usually when a quest is involved in multiple plot-lines. 
The majority of the quest series are based out of a specific area, and their completion is often needed to access either more of that area or specific features within it. For example, West Ardougne as a whole is inaccessible unless at least some progress is made in the Elf series of quests. 

## Subquests
A subquest is a part of another quest, which upon completion gives additional rewards as well as quest point(s). Subquests may take less time and require fewer items, although they may have additional skill or quest requirements. 
Recipe for Disaster, which has nine subquests, one for each member of the Lumbridge council, and the Culinaromancer boss fight 

## Mini-Quests
Miniquests, are smaller pieces of story and skill content that are not required for the Quest point cape, but still tell stories similar to quests. Most miniquests are smaller in scale and shorter than a normal quest, but may have requirements stretching higher than normal quests or none at all. They are usually connected to existing pieces of content or used to tie up loose ends from quests, but some are standalone. 

# Quests
Quests are groups of interrelated tasks, usually involving a story line, that can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours or even a few days to complete.

This is going to be a very extended effort put into for storylines and etc, the quest series will be based on a **choose your own adventure**. Quite literally, some quest objective NPC's can be "killed" and you won't ever be able to talk to them again(depending on their importance, they may appear again later on a timeline.; You can choose *Not* to do whatever you don't feel like doing. You can *choose* not to agree with your mission, and do something totally different, so long as the job get's finished or sabotaged somehow.  Special areas, NPC's, relationships & actions will be capable with different paths & choices you make, and they can affect the outcome of your story, make being in areas & doing different things harder or easier, etc etc.
