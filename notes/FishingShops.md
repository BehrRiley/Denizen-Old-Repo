# Fishing Shop NPC's
Fishing shops primarily will sell the primary Fishing Rods & bait needed for fishing.

## Buy Prices:
Items can be sold at high-value price, increasing by 7.5% after each 10% of item shops stock.
i.e. a shop sells 1000 chaos runes for 54 each, once there is 900 left in stock, the new price is 58, increasing by 4.05 each set of 100(10%) stock.

## Sell Prices:
When selling to a specialty shop, the item can be sold at the item's low-value. ie; Tuna's value is 24; and can be sold for 16. When being sold to a non-specialty shop, the item would normally sell at the item's low-value. This corresponds to two-thirds of the specialty shop price at normal stock.

Every overstocked item causes the selling price to decrease by 7.5% of the initial price. This causes the minimum price to be reached after the store is overstocked with 10 of that item. The minimum price the player receives for selling any item is 10% of the item's value, so 25% of the item's initial (low-value/general store) price.
