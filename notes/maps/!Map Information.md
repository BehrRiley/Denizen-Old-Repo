# Map Information

Map layouts will be pasted here. 

Ideally, we would like terrain and landscape to be replicated as closely as possible, however in Minecraft, buildings will be structured differently as well as some terrain may not be possible. Map files such as WorldPaint based files, world over-views, examples and such will be pasted here.
