Earnest the Chicken Transcript
Starting out

#Talking to Veronica
#First time
Veronica: Can you please help me? I'm in a terrible spot of trouble. My fiancé, Ernest, and I came upon this house. Seeing as we were a little lost, Ernest decided to go in and ask for directions. That was an hour ago...and that house looks spooky. Can you go and see if you can find him for me?
Player: Yes
  Veronica: Thank you, thank you. I'm very grateful. I think I spotted some lights flashing in one of the top floor windows, so you may want to head up there first.
Player: Not Right Now
  Veronica: Oh. I'm so worried. I hope someone will help me soon.

#Prior to discovering that Ernest has become a chicken
Veronica: Have you found my sweetheart yet?
  Player: No, not yet.

#After discovering that Ernest has become a chicken
Veronica: Have you found my sweetheart yet?
  Player: Yes, he's a chicken.
    Veronica: I know he’s not exactly brave, but I think you’re being a bit harsh.
      Player: No, no, he’s been turned into an actual chicken by a mad scientist.
        Veronica: Eeeeeek! My poor darling! Why must these things happen to us?
          Player: I’m doing my best to turn him back.
            Veronica: Well, be quick. I’m sure being a chicken can’t be good for him.

#Entering the Manor
#First time
Player: There's a sign on the door that says:
  Adventurers beware: Going in doesn't mean you'll come out again.
    Do you want to go in?
      Player: Yes.
        The doors slam shut behind you.
      Player: No.

#Professor Oddenstein
#Finding Ernest
#Talking to Professor Oddenstein
Professor Oddenstein: Be careful in here, there's lots of dangerous equipment.
  Player: I'm looking for a guy called Ernest.
    Professor Oddenstein: Ah, Ernest - top notch bloke - he's helping me with my experiments.
      Player: So you know where he is?
        Professor Oddenstein: He's that chicken over there.
          Player: Ernest is a chicken? Are you sure?
            Professor Oddenstein: Oh, he isn't normally a chicken, or, at least, he wasn't until he helped me test my pouletmorph machine. It was originally going to be called a transmutation machine, but after testing it, pouletmorph seems more appropriate.
              Player: I'm glad Veronica didn't actually get engaged to a chicken.
                Professor Oddenstein: Who's Veronica?
                  Player: Ernest's fiancée. She probably doesn't want to marry a chicken.
                    Professor Oddenstein: Oh, I dunno. She could have free eggs for breakfast every morning.
              Player: I think you'd better change him back.
              Player: Change him back this instant!

                Professor Oddenstein: Umm... It's not so easy... My machine is broken, and this house has long been pestered by poltergeists. They seem to reap joy from hiding my belongings and, in this case, the vital parts to my machine.
                  Player: Well, I can look for them.
                    Professor Oddenstein: That would be a huge help. They'll be somewhere in the manor house or its grounds outside. I'm missing the pressure gauge and a rubber tube. They've also taken my oil can, which I'm going to need to get this thing started again.
                      Player: Any clues?
                        Professor Oddenstein: Well, I wouldn't be surprised if you found something in my IQ-testing room under the manor where I test my...creations. Oh, and if I were you, I'd stay away from the coffin in the basement. Even the poltergeists daren't go near it.
                      Player: What does this machine do?
                        Professor Oddenstein: Nothing at the moment...it's broken. It's meant to be a transmutation machine. It has also spent time as a time travel machine, a dramatic lightning generator, and a thing for generating monsters.
                      Player: Is this your house?
                        Professor Oddenstein: No, I'm just one of the tenants. It belongs to the count who lives in the basement.

#Without any of the necessary materials
Professor Oddenstein: Have you found anything yet?
  Player: I'm afraid I don't have any of them yet.
    Professor Oddenstein: I need a rubber tube, a pressure gauge and a can of oil. Then your friend can stop being a chicken.
