Fred the Farmer: What are you doing on my land! You're not the one who keeps leaving all my gates open and letting out all my sheep are you?
    Plyer: I'm looking for work.
        Fred the Farmer: Oh? Well, I could do with a bit of help, since you're offering.
        Fred the Farmer: I need to collect some black wool from my sheep and I'd be much obliged if you could shear them for me. While you're at it, spin the wool into carpet for me too.
            Player: Does it have to be black?
                Fred the Farmer: Has to be. I'm doing business with some guy after black interior design â€“ something to do with black looking 'cool'.
                    Player: It takes all sorts, I suppose.
                        Fred the Farmer: Indeed. So if you bring me 40 things'a black carpet, I'm sure I could sort out some sort of payment.
                    Player: Black carpet cool? I'm not sure that's true.
                        Fred he Farmer: That's what I thought, but I'm certainly not going to turn down the business. So if you bring me 40 things'a black carpet, I'm sure I could sort out some sort of payment.

            Player: So, is this a quest?
                Fred the Farmer: No, it isn't. It's work. You do what I say, then you get paid.
                    Player: That doesn't sound very exciting.
                        Fred the Farmer: Well, what do you expect if you ask a farmer?
                    Player: That's a quest.
                        Fred the Farmer: No it ain't.

                                    Fred the Farmer: Some say it's a black-hearted shape-shifter, hungering for the souls of decent, hardworking folk like me. Slender-man type'a guy. Others say it's just a sheep.

Fred the Farmer: Well, I don't have all day to stand around and gossip. Did you say you knew how to shear sheep?
    Player: Of course!
        Fred the Farmer: Well, get to it then.
    Player: Actually, no, I don't.
        Fred the Farmer: You'll need some shears first. Then use those on sheep to shear'm.
            Player: How do i get shears?
                Fred the Farmer: You can craft'm with two iron ignots, or you can buy'm from the General Store in Lumbridge. That or the Behr Shop's sure to have em somewhere. Just use those on a sheep to shear it.
        #if player has shears
        Fred the Farmer: Well, you're halfway there already. You have some shears in your inventory. Just use those on a sheep to shear it.
            Player: That's all I have to do?
                Fred the Farmer: Well, once you've collected some wool you'll need to spin it into carpet.
                Fred the Farmer: Do you know how to spin carpet?
                    Player: I don't know how to spin carpet, sorry.
                        Fred the Farmer: Don't worry, it's quite simple. The nearest crafting table can be found on the second floor of Lumbridge Castle, southeast of here.
                    Player: Of course.
                        Fred the Farmer: Well, get to it then.
    Player: I'm something of an expert, actually.
