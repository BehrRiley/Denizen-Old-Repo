You have already learned the first thing needed to succeed in this world: Talking to other people! You will find many inhabitants of this world have useful things to say to you. By clicking on them you can talk to them. Before we get going, if you could be so kind to let me know how much experience you have with Old School Runescape, that would be wonderful.
  d2: Wonderful! Thank you.

  p7: I managed to catch some shrimp.
  d8: Excellent work. Now that you have some shrimp, you're going to want to cook them. To do that, you'll need a fire. that brings us on to the woodcutting and firemaking skills.
  u9: the survival expert gives you a bronze axe and a tinderbox.
  u10: It's time to cook your shrimp. However, you require a fire to do that which means you need some logs.  You can cut down trees using your woodcutting skill, all you need is an axe. Give it a go by clicking on one of the trees in the area.

        d23: Logs are not only useful for making fires. Many archers use the skill known Fletching to craft their own bows and arrows from trees.

    - tell me about firemaking again
      d24: certainly, newcomer. When you have logs simply use your tinderbox on them. If successful, you will start a fire.

        d20

    - tell me about cooking again
      d31: yes, the most basic of survival techniques. Most simple foods can be used on a fire to cook them. If you're feeling a bit fancier, you can also use a range to cook the food instead.
      d32: eating cooked food will restore lost health. The harder something is to cook, the more it will heal you.
      d33: 
    - nothing thanks
    - previous options

  p3: I already know how to cook. Brynna taught me just now.
  d4: Hahahahahaha! You call THAT cooking? Some shrimp on an open log fire? Oh, no, no, no. I am going to teach you the fine art of cooking bread.
  u5: The master chef gives you some flour and a bucket of water.

      d12:
# ██ [ Quest Guide dialogue ] ██
  u1: It's time to learn about quests! Just talk to thje quest guide to get started.
  d2: Ah. Welcome, adventurer. I'm here to tell you all about quests. Let's start by opening your quest journal.
  u3: Click on the flashing icon to the left of your inventory
  u4: This is your quest journal. It lists every quest in the game. Talk to the quest guide again for an explaination on how it works.
  d5: now you have the journal open, I'll tell you a bit about it. At the moment all of the quests are shown in red, which means you have not started them yet.
  d6: When you start a quest, it will change the color to yellow. Once you've finished it, it will change to green. This is so you can easily see what's complete, what's started, and what's left to begin.

  d8: if the quest is in progress, it will remind you what to do next.
  d9: It's very easy to find quest start points. Just look out for the quest icon in your minimap. You should see one marking this house.
  u10: The minimap in the top right corner of the screen has various icons to show different points of interest. Look for the iccon to the left to find quest start points.
  d11: The quests themselves can vary greatly from collecting beads to hunting down dragons. Completing quests will reward you will all sorts of things, such as new areas and better weapons!
  d12: There's not a lot more i can tell youn about questing. You have to experience the thrill of it yourself ot fully understand. Let me know if you want a recap, otherwise you can move on.
  u13: It's time to enter some caves. Click on the ladder to go down to the next area.

  u14: Would you like to hear about quests again
    - Yes!
      d15: If you open your quest journal you will see that all of the quests are shown in red at the moment. This means you have not started them yet.
      d6-d12:
    - Nope, i'm ready to move on!
      d16: okay then.
# ██ [ Mining Instructor dialogue ] ██
  d1: Hi there. You must be new around here. So, what do I call you? 'Newcomer' seems so impersonal; and if we're going to be working together, I'd rather call you by name.
  d2: Ok then, <player.name>. My name is Dezzick and I'm a miner by trade. Let's teach you how to mine.
  d3: Mining is very simple, all you need is a pickaxe. The rocks around here contain tin and copper. Why don't you get started by mining some? If you're unsure which is which, you can prospect them to find out.
  u4: the mining instructor gives you a bronze pickaxe
  u5: It's quite simple really. To mine a rock, all you do is click on it. First up, try mining some tin. If you're unsure which rock is which, you can right-click on one and select the prospect option.
  u6: you prospect the rock...
  u7: this rock contains tin.
  u8: This rock contains copper.
  d9: Now that you have some ore, you should smelt it into a bronze bar. You can use the furnace over there to do so.
  u10: Smelting - You now have some tin ore and some copper ore. You can smelt these into a bronze bar. To do so, just click on the indicated furnace. Try it now.
  u11: You smelt the ore.
  u12: You've made a bronze bar! Speak to the mining instructor and he'll show you how to make it into a weapon.
  p13: I Have a bronze bar. Now what?
  d14: Now that you've got a bar, you can smith it into a weapon. To smith something, you need a hammer and an anvil. There are some anvils just here than you can use. See if you can make a bronze dagger.
  u15: The mining instructor gives you a hammer.
  d16: See if you can use the anvil here to make a bronze dagger.
  u17: To smith you'll need a hammer and enough metal bars to make the desired items, as well as a handy anvil. To start the process, click on the anvil, or alternatively use the bar on it.
  u18: now you have the smiting menu open, you will see a list of all the things you can make. Only the dagger can be made at your sill level; this is shown by the white text under it. You'll need to select the dagger to continue.
  u19: Congratulations, you've made your first weapon. Now it's time to move on. Go through the gates shown by the arrow. 

  d20: Would you like me to recap anything?
    - tell me about prospecting again.
    d21: It's really very simple. Usually when you go mining you can see if there is more in a rock or not by its color.
    d22: if you come across a rock you've not seen before and want to know what it is, or if you can't tell if a rock contains ore just by sight, just simply right-click on the rock and select prospect to check closely. Anything else you wanted to know?
    - tell me about Mining again.
      d23: Certainly. To mine you need a pickaxe. Different pickaxes let you mine more efficiently.
      d24: Earlier I gave you a bronze pickaxe, which is the most inefficient pickaxe available, but is perfect for a beginner. 
      d25: to mine, simply click on a rock that contains ore while you have a pickaxe with you, and you will keep mining the rock until you manage to get some ore, or until it is empty.
      d26: the better the pickaxe you use, the faster you will get ore from the rock you're mining.
      d27: You will be able to buy better pickaxes from the Dwarven Mine when you reach the mainland, but they can be expensive.
      d28: Also, the better the pickaxe the higher the mining level required to use it will be. Was there anything else you wanted to hear?
    - Tell me about smelting again.
      d30: smelting is very easy. Simply take the ores required to make a metal to a furnace, then use the ores on the furnace to smelt them into a bar of metal. 
      d31: furnaces are expensive to build and maintain, so there are not that many scattered around the world. I suggest when you find one you remember its location for future use.
      d32: an alternative to using a furnace is to smelt your ore is to use high-level magic to do it.
      d33: as well as letting you smelt ore anywhere, it has a guaranteed success rate in smelting ores.
      d34: Some metals, such as iron, contain impurities and can be destroyed during the smelting process in a traditional furnace, but magical heat does not destroy the item.
      d35: Anything else?
    - Tell me about smiting again.
      d36: When you have acquired enough bars of metal you wish to work with, you are ready to begin smiting.
      d37: Take the hammer I gave you, or buy a new one from a general store, and proceed to a nearby anvil.
      d38: It's a straightforward skill as I'm sure you discovered while making me that lovely bronze dagger.
      d39: The higher smithing level you are, the better quality the metal you can work with. You start off on bronze and work your way up as your smithing skills increase.
      d35:
    - nope, I’m ready to move on!
      d36: okay then.

# ██ [ Combat Instructor dialogue ] ██
  u1: In this area you will find out about melee and ranged combat. Speak to the guide and he will tell you all about it.
  p2: Hi, my name is <Player.name>
  d3: Do I look like I care? To me you're just another newcomer who thinks theyre ready to fight.
  d4: I am Vannaka, the greatest swordsman alive, and I'm here to teach you the basics of combat. Let's get started by teaching you to wield a weapon.
  u5: You now have access to a new interface. Click on the flashing icon of a man, the one to the right of your backpack icon.
  u6: This is your worn inventory. Here you can see what items you have equipped. In the bottom left corner, you will notice a flashing button with a shield and helmet on it. This button lets you view more details on what you have equipped. Click on it now.
  u7: You can see what items you are wearing in the worn inventory to the left of the screen, with their combined statistics on the right. Let's add something. Click your dagger to equip it.
  u8: you're now holding your dagger. Clothes, armor, weapons and more are equipped like this. you can unequip items by clicking on them in the worn inventory. Speak to the combat instructor to continue.
  d9: Very good, but that little butter knife isn't going to protect you much. Let's get you something a bit better. Once you're properly equipped, we can move on to some actual combat
  u10: The combat instructor gives you a bronzer sword and a wooden shield.
  u11: to unequip an item, go to your worn inventory and click on the item. Alternatively, equipping anew item into the same slot will unequip the old one. Try this out now by swapping your dagger for the sword and shield the combat instructor gave you.
  u12: click the flashing crossed swords icon to open the combat interface
  d13: Let's get you equip.
  u14: This is your combat interface. From here, you can select the attack style that you’ll use in combat. using different attack styles will give different types of experience. As well s this, mosnters are weak to speccific attack styles. Click on the gates to continue.
  d15: Time for some actual combat! Head into the pen and kill one of those rats!
  u16: It's time to slay some rats! To attack a rat, all you have to do is click on it. This will cause you to walk over and start hitting it.
  u17: Pass through the gate and talk to the combat instructor. He will give you your next task.
  p18: I did it! I killed a giant rat!
  d19: I saw. You seem better at this than I thought. Now that you have grasped basic swordplay, let’s move on.
  d20: Next up we have ranged attacking. With this you can kill foes from a distance. With ranged, you'll be able to attack the rats without entering the pit meaning they won’t be able to attack back.
  d21: The combat instructor gives you a short bow and some bronze arrows
  d22: Now you have a bow and some arrows. Before you can use them, you'll need to equip them. Once equipped with the ranging gear, try killing another rat. You don’t need to enter the pen this time. To attack a rat, just click on it.
  d23: Use your bow and arrows to kill one of those rats from outside the pen.
  u24: Now you have a bow and some arrows. Before you can use them, you’ll need to equip them. Once equipped with the ranging gear, try killing another rat. You don’t need to enter the pen this time. To attack a rat, just click on it.
  u25: You have completed the tasks here. To move on, click on the indicated ladder. If you need to go over any of what you learnt here, just talk to the combat instructor and he’ll tell you what he can.
  d26: do you need something?
  - tell me about combat stats
  d27: certainly. You have three main combat stats: Strength, defense and Attack
  d28: Strength determines the maximum hit you will be able to deal with your blows, Defence determines the amount of damage you will be able to defend and attack and determines the accuracy of your blows.
  d29: Other stats are used in combat such as Prayer, Hitpoints, Magic and Ranged. All of these stats can go towards determining your combat level, which is shown near the top of your combat interface screen.
  d30: You will find out on the mainland that certain items can also affect your stats. There are potions that can be drunk that alter your stats temporarily, such as raising Strength.
  d31: You will also raise your Defence and Attack values by using different weapons and armors.
  d32: before going into combat with an opponent it is wise to put the mouse over them and see what combat level they are.
  d33: Green colored writing usually means it will be an easy fight for you, red means you will probably lose, yellow means they are around your level and orange mean they are slightly stronger.
  d34: Sometimes things will go on your way, sometimes they won't. there is no such thing as a guaranteed win, but if the odds are on your side, you stand the best chance of walking away victorious. 
  d35: Now, was there something else you wanted to hear about again?
  - tell me about melee combat again
  d36: Ah, my specialty. Close combat fighting, which is also known as melee fighting, covers all combat done at close range to your opponent. 
  d37: melee fighting depends entirely upon your three basic combat stats: Attack, Defence and Strength.
  d38: Also, of course, it depends on the quality of your armor and weaponry. A high-levelled fighter with good armor and weapons will be deadly up close.
  d39: if this is the path you wish to take, remember your success depends on the getting as close to your enemy as quickly as possible
  d40: Personally, I consider the fine art of melee combat to be the ONLY combat method worth using.
  d35:
  - tell me about ranged combat again
  d36: thinking of being a ranger, eh? Well, okay. I don't enjoy it myself, but I can see the appeal. 
  d37: ranging employs a lot of different weapons as a skill, not just the short bow you have there. Spears, throwing knives, and crossbows are all used best at a distance from your enemy.
  d38: Now, those rats were easy pickings, but ton the mainland you will be very lucky if you can find a spot where you can shoot at your enemies without them being able to retaliate.
  d39: At close range, rangers often do badly in combat. Your best tactic as a ranger is to hit and run, keeping your foe at a distance.
  d40: your effectiveness as a ranger is almost entirely dependent on your ranged stat. As with all skills, the more you train it, the more powerful it will become.
  d41: Anything else you wanted to know?
  - tell me about the Wilderness
  d42: Ah, yes, the wilderness. It is a place of evil, mark my words. Many is the colleague I have lost in that foul place.
  d43: It is also a place of both adventure and wealth, so if you are brave enough and strong enough to survive it, you will make a killing. Literally!
  d44: It is also the only place in the land of Gielinor where players are able to attack each other at will, and as such is the haunt of many Player Killers, or PKers if you will.
  d45: There are a few things different in the wilderness in comparison to the rest of the lands of Gielinor. Firstly, as I just mentioned, you can and will be attacked by other players.
  d46: For this reason, you will be given a warning when you approach the wilderness, as it is not a place you would wish to enter by accident.
  d47: Secondly, there are a number of 'levels' to it. the further into it you travel, the greater the range of people you can attack
  d48: in level 1 wilderness you will only be able to attack or be attacked by, those players within one combat level of yourself. 
  d49: in level 50, any player within fifty levels of you will be able to attack, or be attacked by you. Always keep an eye on what level of the wilderness you are currently in.
  d50: Your current wilderness level is shown at the bottom right of the screen. The final thing you should know about the wilderness is being 'skulled'.
  d51: If you attack another player without them having attacked first, you will gain a skull above your character’s head.
  d52: What this means is that if you die while skulled, you will lose EVERYUTHING that your character was carrying.
  d53: When skulled, you should try to avoid dying for the twenty minutes or so it will take for the skull to wear off. 
  d54: If you wish to find the wilderness, head north from the where you start on the mainland. It is rather large and hard to miss.
  d55: If you don't wish to end up there, take notice of the warning you will receive when getting near to it.
  d35:
  u36: follow the path and you will come to the front of the building. This is the bank of Gielinor, where you can store all your most valued items. To open your bank, just click on the indicated booth.
  - Nope, I’m ready to move on!
  d: Okay then.

# ██ [ bank shit dialogue ] ██

d: This is your magic interface. all of your spells are listed here. Talk to the instructor to learn more.
d: currently you can only cast one offensive spell called Wind Strike. Let's try that out on one of those chickens.
d: Terrova gives you some air and mind runes.
d: You n ow have some runes. air spells require runes to cast them. Look for the wind strike spell in your magic interface. Click on the spell to select it and then click on a chicken to cast it. Talk to the instructor if you need more runes.
u: sorry, i don't have any more runes just now. But i see you have plenty.
d: well, youre all finished here now. Ill give you a reasonable number of runes when you leave.
