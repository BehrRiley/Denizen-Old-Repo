# Treasure Trails & Clue Scrolls

## Difficulty Levels
The level of the clue relates to it's difficulty. There are five levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, Elite and Master. 

### Easy Clues
an Easy clue is a low difficulty, with a low reward yield. 
Easy clue scrolls can be between 2-4 clues long with few or no quest requirements.

### Medium Clues
Medium is a higher difficulty, yielding a more substantial reward. 
Medium clue scrolls can be between 3-5 clues long with some quest requirements.

### Hard Clues
Hard clues will be Hazardous, and Can be very rewarding. 
Hard clue scrolls can be between 4-6 clues long, with multiple enemies to defeat and can have high-levelled quest requirements.

### Elite Clues
Elite clues are the second most dangerous (Both to receieve **and** to complete). They require killing higher leveled custom mobs, which is rewarded by much greater and expensive rewards compared to the others before it's difficulty. 
Elite clue scrolls can be between 5-7 (on rare occasions 8) clues long, with multiple fights, and puzzles every step.

### Master Clues
Master clues are the most difficult to complete, and can only be obtained as a reward from other clue scrolls or by handing one of each tier clue in trade for the Master.
Master clue scrolls can be between 6-8 clues long, with multiple fights, and puzzles every step. Very high levelled skills recommended.

## Types of Clues & Treasure Trails
### Anagrams
An anagram is a string of letters, which can be rearranged into another word or phrase. For example: orchestra is an anagram of carthorse. 
The solution of an anagram is always the name of an NPC. Once the solution is found, the player can get their next clue by talking to that NPC. Often, when talking to an NPC, the player will receive a challenge scroll or even a puzzle box that they must solve before receiving the next clue. 
The anagrams in clue scrolls do not correspond with the number of spaces in a name; an anagram with no spaces may have an answer with a name corresponding with one or more spaces. 

### Challenge Scrolls
Challenge scrolls are logical problems posed to the player by an NPC. Challenge scrolls appear in medium, hard, and elite clues. Challenge scrolls are 'step two' of a clue. To complete the scroll, view the question on the scroll, then speak to the NPC which gave it to provide the answer. When the correct answer is provided the challenge is complete, and the player will receive either the next clue, or the reward.
Harder clue difficulties will result in often time spontaneous, hazardous traps with high risk monsters.

### Cipher Clue Scrolls
A cipher is a string of letters which have been purposefully scrambled using the Caesar cipher method. Example: ZCZL is unscrambled by shifting each letter through the English alphabet forward by one letter, and becomes ADAM (A comes after Z again). However, each cipher can be different - some require more shifts than one. The solution will be the name of an NPC, who you need to speak to in order to receive a challenge. These challenges include challenge scrolls and puzzle boxes.

**Cipher Clue Example**:
```
  D   M
  ▲   ▲
Z C Z L
▼   ▼  
A   A
==
A D A M

ZCZL --> ADAM
```

### Coordinate Clue Scrolls
A coordinate clue is a clue scroll that contains a set of coordinates. Much like the real-world longitude & latitude geographic coordinate system, coordinates in minecraft indicate a precise point somewhere on the surface where the next clue scroll, or potentially the treasure casket, is buried. Coordinate clues will only appear in Treasure Trails of medium difficulty or above. Note: For Hard or Elite Coordinate clues, expect combat.

### Cryptic Clues / Simple Clue Scrolls
This section includes both simple and cryptic clues. Simple clues are clues containing a straightforward message such as "Search the boxes in a house in Lumbridge". Cryptic clues are similar to simple clues, but with increased difficulty. They are found essentially in medium and higher level clues. These clues demand a fairly wide variety of tasks, anything from leading the player to speak with an NPC, searching a designated crate, or directing the player to dig in some fairly obscure location. However, these tasks usually require an additional task in order to complete the clue. These challenges include: finding a key, or completing a puzzle box.

### Map Clues Scrolls 
Map clues are an image of the location the player needs to search to advance along their trail. Maps are found across all levels of clue scroll. They are rough pictures of a very local area. If the map leads to an [ X ], the player needs to take a spade to the place indicated on the map with the [ X ] and dig there. If the map leads to a chest, it must simply be searched. Sometimes players may find a small pile of chests, or a multitude of them. Search all of them until the next clue or the reward is found. Maps can include landmarks such as buildings, roads, rivers, bridges, and other things. You know, stuff you see with your eyes. The image will be actually printed onto the map, i'm developing something that will let us put straight images onto the maps.

### Puzzle Clues Scrolls
When speaking to an NPC in a hard or elite trail, the player may receive a puzzle box. Puzzle boxes are 'step two' of a clue: first the player has to find the right NPC to speak to (when they get a cryptic or anagram clue), and then they have to solve the puzzle, to advance along their trail. Puzzle boxes contain a scrambled image that players must work to unscramble and place into the box correctly, or just a general puzzle must be completed. Examples to come...  Once the puzzle box is completed, players will need to talk to the NPC who gave the puzzle to receive the next clue or the reward.

kind of an example?
```
Shulker box will contain 9 maps with images;
Place them in order on item frames, remove & place carefully back in 
the shulkerbox and you can check with the NPC if it's correct or not.
```
